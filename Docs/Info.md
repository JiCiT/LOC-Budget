# Purpose

Houses:

1. Configurational/operational data
1. Sample transactions

# Data

## Budget Year

The year for which this entire file applies.

## Include Actuals After Today

Flag indicating whether entries in [Transactions - Actuals](./doc/Transactions%20-%20Actuals.md) sheet that occur after the present day should be used in calculations in various sheets.

## Account Types

Lists all possible account types along with:

1. An indicator determining if the account increases via debits or credits.
1. An indicator determining what type of account balance is a "good thing" when comparing budget to actual.

# Sample Transactions

These show typical sample transaction entries that one might use when doing [envolope budgeting](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/envelope-system) by _virtually_ moving monies from a "checking" account into a various virtual envelope "savings" accounts while _actually_ moving the money into a ***<u>single</u>*** real "savings" account.  This accounting method allows one to simultaneously see the **actual** amounts that are in both the real and virtual accounts.

Note the differences between "soft" and "hard" moves in the explanations that follow.  The least complicated scenario is to employee "soft" moves exclusively.  However, using "hard" moves means one won't see the funds when looking at their "checking" account balance which may be preferable.

## "Direct" Move

Move money from _actual_ checking to _actual_ savings and simultaneously into a _virtual_ envelope account.

## "Soft" Move

_Virtually_ move money from _actual_ checking to a _virtual_ envelope account.  The _actual_ money remains in checking.

This sort of move makes sense if one intends to use the funds relatively quickly after the move because the _actual_ money remains in the checking account and it's typically much easier to pay from a checking account.

## "Harden" Previous "Soft" Move

This is for the case where a "soft" move was done in the past, those funds haven't been used, and one now wants to _actually_ move the funds from "checking" to "savings".

## Buy from Checking

The next samples assume that purchases are being made from Checking ***even if*** the funds have been _actually_ moved to savings.  Again, assuming that making purchases with funds in "checking" is easier than from "savings" regardless of where the funds _actually_ sit.  Of course, funds must be available in "checking" to cover the purchase!

### Funds in Savings

In this case the funds exist in "savings", but the purchase is being made from "checking" for convenience.

The _optional_ "pay back" from savings to checking may occur simultaneously ***or*** it may occur separately at a later time.  That is multiple purchases of this type may be "stored up" and a single transaction from "savings" to "checking" may be done, for example, once at the end of every month.

### Funds in Checking

In this case *only* a "soft" move was ever made.  The _actual_ funds never left checking.
